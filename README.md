# foodie

Foodie is a one-stop-shop mobile app for an individual's culinary needs. The app features a recipe organizer, a searchable library of recipes, and a local restaurant finder.
User data is preserved across sessions and is stored securely in the cloud through Firebase, allowing for use across multiple devices. The app is built with React Native (cross-platform),
but only supports Android devices due to utilization of device hardware (e.g. geolocation sensors). I could easily modify it to support iOS devices as well, but I do not have access
to the necessary development tools (i.e. Xcode).
